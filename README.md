Tempestas â€“ Weather + Clothing Suggestion Web App
Live Demo

Overview
Tempestas is a lightweight weather assistant that fetches live weather data for any city and recommends what to wear based on the temperature and conditions.

This project was inspired by the idea of making weather data more useful and actionable, especially during busy mornings or travel planning.

Key Features
Fetches real-time weather using the OpenWeatherMap API

Provides clear outfit suggestions (factoring in cold, heat, rain, and snow)

Displays current time and a short-term hourly forecast

Clean, mobile-friendly UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Hosted on GitHub Pages for public access

How I Built It
Step 1: Tested the OpenWeatherMap API using Python to understand inputs and responses

Step 2: Built a Python script to display weather and confirm consistent results

Step 3: Created a styled frontend interface for user input and display

Step 4: Wrote condition-based fashion logic to enhance utility

Step 5: Deployed the project publicly via GitHub Pages

Future Possibilities
This concept could be expanded into:

A smart alarm assistant that sends outfit suggestions when you wake up

A voice assistant skill (e.g., Alexa, Siri) for daily weather + clothing briefings

A widget for smart mirrors or fitness apps
